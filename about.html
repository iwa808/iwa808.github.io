<p>Shannon is a 40-something Marine Corps spouse with a professional background in management consulting in the government and defense sector. When multiple relocations for her husband's job made her unable to maintain her career, she decided to forge a new path and learn to code. Shannon sees software development as a viable and exciting path for military spouses to build rewarding careers that will move with them wherever their service member is called to serve. She hopes to be an example and to inspire other military spouses to make the journey into technology.</p>
